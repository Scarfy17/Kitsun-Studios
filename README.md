The Airahsi.squiffy file under the Master branch should not be edited by contributors. Instead, they should write in the Airashi.squiffy file inside their own folder. Do not edit files such as the license.
Please write a log of your commitments before commiting an edit.

Documentation on Squiffy can be found here: http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/

Don't touch the "Export Folder", unless you wanna test the game.
